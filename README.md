### ðŸŽ² Guesser - Windows Forms App

**Description**:
Guesser is an exciting interactive game developed in C# using Windows Forms. In this game, the objective is to guess a random number generated by the application in the fewest possible attempts. The project stands out in user interface design, object-oriented programming, and efficient event handling in desktop applications.

**Key Features**:
- **Smooth Interactivity**: Responds to both button click events and the Enter key for a dynamic and accessible user experience.
- **Form Management**: Includes interaction between the main form and an end-game form to display result messages and manage game restart or exit.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Automatically updates the interface with messages and attempt counts to provide instant feedback on the game's status.
- **Error Handling**: Utilizes an `ErrorProvider` to manage invalid entries and ensure users receive clear guidance on input errors.
- **Consistent Positioning**: The end-game form is displayed in the same location as the main form, ensuring a coherent user experience.

**Technologies Used**:
- C#
- Windows Forms
- .NET Framework

**Objectives**:
- **Interface Design**: Implements an intuitive and visually appealing interface to enhance user interaction.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Applies principles of encapsulation and event handling for a modular and maintainable code architecture.
- **Validation and Error Handling**: Ensures user inputs are valid and provides efficient error handling.

This project demonstrates skills in desktop application development, offering a clear view of the ability to create interactive user interfaces and manage game logic effectively.
